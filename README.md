1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the Voice app:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

4. Access the Voice app at `http://localhost:5000`

## Deployment with Helm

To deploy the Voice app using Helm, follow these steps:

1. Add the Helm repository and update:
   ```
   helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
   helm repo update
   ```

2. Update dependencies:
   ```
   helm dependency update ./voice-app
   ```

3. Install the Voice app:
   ```
   helm install voice-app ./voice-app
   ```

For more detailed information about the Helm chart, please refer to the [Helm Chart README](./voice/helm/README.md).
